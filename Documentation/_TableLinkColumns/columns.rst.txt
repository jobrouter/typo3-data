Columns (required)
   Define the columns that should be synchronised. Each column has the following
   fields:

   JobData Column Name (required)
      The name of the column as defined in the JobData table.

   Label (optional)
      The label of the column. It will be shown as header of the table when
      using the plugin.

   Type (required)
      Select the column type (:guilabel:`Text`, :guilabel:`Integer`,
      :guilabel:`Decimal`, :guilabel:`Date`, :guilabel:`DateTime`) as defined
      in the JobData table.

   Decimal places
      This option is only shown with type :guilabel:`Decimal`. Select the number
      of decimals to be used.

   Field size
      This option is only shown with type :guilabel:`Text`. Enter the size of
      the field. When sending the fields of a form to a JobData table with
      the :ref:`form finisher <form-finisher>` the values are truncated if too
      long to prevent errors when transmitting the data. To disable the
      truncation enter 0.

   .. important::
      The `jrid` column must not be defined as it is available by default.
